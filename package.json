    "description": "AWS CloudTrail This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of\nactions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.\n\nCloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and\ndelivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the\nidentity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the source IP address,\nthe request parameters, and the response elements returned by the service.\n\nAs an alternative to the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of\nlibraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java,\nRuby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create\nprogrammatic access to AWSCloudTrail. For example, the SDKs take care of\ncryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests\nautomatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and\ninstall them, see the Tools for Amazon Web Services page\n[http://aws.amazon.com/tools/].\n\nSee the AWS CloudTrail User Guide\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html] \nfor information about the data that is included with each AWS API call listed in\nthe log files.",
